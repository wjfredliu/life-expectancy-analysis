# Life Expectancy Analysis

After taking an Economics of Medical Care class, I wanted to examine the elements that affect a nation's life expectancy. My goal is to develop a model capable of predicting life expectancy by considering a range of socioeconomic and health-related factors. Key predictors in this model include the development status of each country, rates of adult and infant mortality, vaccination coverage, and population size.

I plan to use a dataset from Kaggle, originally sourced from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory. It spans 15 years (2000-2015) and covers 193 countries, with 20 predictors for each country. This dataset will enable me to analyze how socioeconomic, political, and health factors in these countries affect life expectancy. If my findings are statistically significant, I'll also examine major events in these countries that could have influenced the results.

**Hypothesis:** I expect less developed countries to have lower life expectancies. Additionally, I anticipate that countries with higher rates of Hepatitis B, Polio, and Measles will show lower life expectancy. Furthermore, I predict that higher vaccination rates, increased GDP per capita, and greater government health expenditure will be associated with higher life expectancy.

**Disclaimer: ** The dataset from Kaggle has inaccurate data that will affect findings and takeaways.
